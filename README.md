sf-ellis-evictions
==================

This is the code responsible for producing the interactive graph of SF evictions and home prices [seen here](http://dangrover.github.io/sf-ellis-evictions/).

There's some Python code for munging the housing price data, as well as the original JS source for the page. The page can be built and run locally using `grunt dev`. 

This code can be used for learning purposes, but the mashup itself is copyright 2013 KEQED Inc, all rights reserved..
