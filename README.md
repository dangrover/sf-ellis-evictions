sf-ellis-evictions
==================

This is the code responsible for producing the graph of SF evictions and home prices [seen here](http://dangrover.github.io/sf-ellis-evictions/).

There is some python code that produced the housing price data, as well as the original JS source for the page. The page can be built and run locally using `grunt dev`.
